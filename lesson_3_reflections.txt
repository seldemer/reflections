When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to work on it from multiple computers, when other people will be collaborating, or if there is some other reason that you want to share your work.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe you want to pull a version that is at a logical point of completedness or process, in the case where you are waiting for certain changes to be made by others.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: make a copy of someone's Github repository into your own Github account. Use when you don't have permission to edit a repository.
Clone: Copy a Github repository to local, or copy local to local. Use this when you don't need to link back to the original repository and/or push changes to it.
Branch: Make a new branch of commits in any repository that you have permission to edit. Use this when you are trying a new change or addition to test it out, before merging.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You are able to work with it offline if you temporarily don't have internet access.
